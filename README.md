# acai-berry

A Tensorflow implementation of ACAI from:

[Berthelot, David, et al. **"Understanding and Improving Interpolation in Autoencoders via an Adversarial Regularizer."** arXiv preprint arXiv:1807.07543 (2018).](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07543)

*Only for the line toy experiment.

Note that this is NOT the original implementation. The original authors' implementation is [here](https://github.com/brain-research/acai).
